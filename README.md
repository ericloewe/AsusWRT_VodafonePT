Adapted from scripts posted to [a thread on the Zwame forum](https://forum.zwame.pt/threads/substituir-router-vodafone-fibra.627747/post-13717439/), derived from [similar scripts for Meo](https://github.com/twelve17/merlin-meo-scripts), themselves derived from [an earlier version](https://github.com/zipleen/tomato-ddwrt-meo-iptv-scripts).
